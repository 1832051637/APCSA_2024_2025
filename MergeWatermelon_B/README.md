## 📖 Project Description
Inspired by the popular "Big Watermelon" game, this project simulates fruit merging with realistic physics — including gravity, bouncing, and collision. Players drop fruits that merge into larger ones when identical fruits touch. 
- WARNING! The game’s behavior can be **unpredictable**, with bugs emerging from complex interactions — but that’s part of its charm.
