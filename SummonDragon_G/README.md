## 📖 Project Description
Dragon Pond is a survival and evolution game made in Java. You swim around a magical pond, using the mouse to turn and WASD to speed up. By eating and merging smaller creatures, you grow stronger and aim to summon the dragon. But there’s a twist — you can only see a limited area around you, and strong predators will chase you if you get too close.

- HOW TO RUN
```bash
java .\src\DragonPondGame.java
```
