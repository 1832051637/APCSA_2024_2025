## 📖 Project Description
Crazy version of the brick bounce game. The player must press keys 1–5 to switch the ball’s color. Only bricks with the same color can be destroyed. Hitting a wrong-colored brick causes the player to lose health, while breaking the correct one restores it. 
- Erjie loves the music.
